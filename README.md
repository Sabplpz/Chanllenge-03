# Password Generator

## Description

This project was given tto us with all the HTML and CSS, with only the intention of creating some Javascript code to make the site functional.
However, I added my own twist to the CSS, to match my vibe. This project was created to provide secure passwords to my friends and family, or even me!
This takes the weight off our shoulders of having to think about a good password. I learnt a lot of Javascript with this one, it made me moere confident with what I am coding.

## Usage

Once in the website, please click on the generate password button. This will start a series of questions which need to be answered to create the password you want.
Once all questions have been answered, the password will pop up on the text box in the website.

Please see an example of the password generator below, expect to see my own tweaks :).
